This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file contains an Express app with an asynchronous operation that may fail.  The failure is logged to the console, but no error response is sent to the client. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to properly handle this using `.catch()` to send appropriate error responses.
